# Exploratory Data Analysis of Chicago Crime Dataset

This is an in-house task Data Science Track of AltSchool Africa Student.
It is done by Circle 23 during the second semester, year 2023/2024



We're going to analyze the dataset using the flowing workflow:

## Understand the Problem & Data

The key questions that should be answered here are:
- What exactly am I looking for inside the data? What type of data am I working with (Geospatial, Time-series, Financial etc)?
- What are my expectations? Understanding the specific outcomes one trying to impact.
- Who is this data for? Who are the key users (General public, Analyst, Managers).
- What and what motivates them? What would I want to communicate to the audience? Then let the analysis fit into the bigger picture.


## Data Preprocessing (Data Wrangling)
   This is about creating clean, quality data for analysis which involves **Quality Assurance (QA), and Basic Profiling**

<u>Quality Assurance</u> is finding and tackling anything that will affect/skew the analysis like:

a. Duplicates

b. Empty /Null values

c. The right data type

d. String Trimming / Abbreviations

e. Outliers


## Features Engineering
   We'll be starting with, <u>Date Profiling</u> - This is using metrics to profile the dataset (Counts, Mean, Median etc). This is for better understanding of our data to know the target (response) variable & feature variables.


Just like we roughly guessed the important columns to consider earlier, here's where the thorough understanding of each column comes in. We need to know how one column relate to another which we will be used for our analysis.

Note also that, features engineering is <u>iterateable</u>. If the columns you have are not making sense, go back to the full dataset and look for the ones that might make sense.


## Analyze & Visualize the Data
   
   **Context is Key here**. It is <u>context</u> that gives <u>numbers meaning</u>. Another highlight here is to use the correct charts & visuals that are suited for the type of data you're working with, the story you're communicating & the end user consuming the information.

If you don't know the full story about the data, add some filters for exploratory so that user can explore on their own, answer new questions & discover fresh insights. Do not prioritize variety over effectiveness, choose the right chart for the job.

<u>Clarity</u> always trumps <u>aesthetic</u>. Cut out anything that's not necessary - colors, background images, 3Ds et ceteral.


## Develop Data-driven Insights
Numbers, charts or graphs doesn't inspire, it's the stories that inspire people. 

Answer These Questions:

- What are your findings from your analysis?

- What do you want your users to see?

Ensure that you tell a clear data-driven stories, designed to expose key insights and inspire stakeholders to act. 

Remember, if your Insights doesn't inspire action or facilitate change, it has zero purpose.
